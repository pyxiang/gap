## Gap Sequence Annotation Tool for Sniffles  
A simple gap sequence annotation tool for sniffles SV result.
### Usage
>python3 gap_anno.py `<`vcf`>` `<`outfile`>` `<`bp`>` `<`dataset`>`  

>usage:gap_anno.py [options]  

>gap sequence annotation for sniffles vcf  

>optional arguments:   
> `<`vcf`>`         &nbsp;sniffles vcf file  
> `<`outfile`>`     &nbsp;output filename including path  
> `<`bp`>`          &nbsp;set the range of sequence  
> `<`dataset`>`     &nbsp;the segmentduplication sequence that you refer

### Work Flow

1. Input the sniffles SV result and range of the chrmosome position 

2. For Translocation, if the range of one breakpoint of sniffles result is covered by dataset, the result will be annotated.For others svtype, if the range of one breakpoint of sniffles result is overlapped by dataset, the result will be annotated   

3. Output the annotated result
